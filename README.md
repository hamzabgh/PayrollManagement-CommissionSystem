# Employee Hierarchy System

This project implements a class hierarchy for different types of employees within a company. It is a simple Java-based application demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), specifically abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces.

## Features

- Abstract `Employee` class with common attributes and methods
- Interface `Displayable` for displaying employee details and earnings
- Different subclasses for various types of employees:
  - `CommissionEmployee`
  - `BasePlusCommissionEmployee`
  - `HourlyEmployee`
  - `SalariedEmployee`


## Usage

Compile the Java files and run the main class. You can extend the functionality by adding your own classes or modifying the existing hierarchy as needed.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/hamzabgh/PayrollManagement-CommissionSystem.git
